              During my MSc. Thesis I developed and patented an algorithm to
              create a manufacturable high performance composite laminates. In
              the start-up Laminance, we are pushing these laminates to several
              industries, specifically aiming for the aerospace sector. As
              Co-Founder I push the algorithm and contact aerospace vendors for
              adoption.

              Since the founding of Flying Fish I have been employed as an
              engineer and full stack developer. I created a highly scalable
              planningstool for a complex taxi network that is currently used by
              the Watertaxi Rotterdam. It was my responsibility to launch these
              changes without any downtime.

              Next to my Aerospace Engineering study I worked as an engineer for
              the TU Delft Solarboat team. As a drivetrain engineer and pilot I
              maintained good connection with all engineering and strategy
              departments. During the races I was responsible for stabilizing
              the boat and propelling it to the finish as quick as possible.
